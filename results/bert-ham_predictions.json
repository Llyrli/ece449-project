    "Subject:ECE486:Control Systems-1122-LEC(Fall 2024): Plans on Lecture and Midterm Tests\nDear All, \n\nGreat work on completing the first 10 weeks of the course! 6 more to go for this semester, keep it up!\n\nNext two lectures, I will be back to do Nyquist Stability Analysis before Prof Chen resumes his lectures on state-space control design methods. In addition, I will hand out your Term Test 1 papers to check. Please let me know if you have problems with the paper before Nov 21.\n\n\n\nWe notice a drop in attendance and participation as we tally Dingtalk data periodically. It is important to stay actively engaged in class. Based on past years experience, students need to really pay close attention in class to visualize and understand the transformations between complex planes and Nyquist plots.  Trust me, it's not easy to follow just the notes for Nyquist analysis. So are many other topics to come.\n\nSee you in class! Meantime, stay safe and keep yourself warm.  :) \n\nBest regards,\n\nLiangjing": "Ham",

    "Reminders about Civilized and Safe Residential College\nReminders about Civilized and Safe Residential College\n\nDear Residents,\n\nThanks for your valuable feedback on building a civilized Residential College. In order to create a better living environment, we kindly remind all residents once again of the following precautions.\n\n1.Noise Reminder\n\nThe Residential College serves both as a rest area and a study area. Recently, we have received multiple complaints from residents about noise from gatherings after 22:00. It is understandable that some students need appropriate relaxation and social interaction. However, noise after 22:00 disturbs the rest of other students, disrupts the order of the Residential College, and violates related regulations. We kindly ask all resident students to consciously keep their voices down after 22:00. To ensure everyone has a quiet environment for rest, regular patrols will be scheduled at 22:00, 23:00, and 00:00 to promptly remind those engaging in noisy activities. Necessary measures will be taken against those who fail to comply after repeated reminders.\n\n2.Vehicle Safety\n\nRecently, we have received feedback from students regarding certain behaviors in and around the Residential College, such as revving car engines loudly, multiple individuals riding electric bikes together or chasing each other, and using mobile phones while moving. Hereby, in order to ensure the safety of others on campus, we specifically remind all residents that it is prohibited to engage in dangerous behaviors including accelerating rapidly by flooring the accelerator, revving engines loudly, carrying three or more people on electric bicycles, and chasing each other while riding.\n\n3.Fire Safety\n\nThis November, the Residential College has conducted a fire safety inspection in collaboration with the Haining City Fire Brigade and the Office of Campus Operations and Support. All residents are kindly reminded to strictly abide by the Residential College\u2019 s regulations on the use of electrical appliances. To avoid causing fire accidents or other safety hazards, any prohibited electrical appliances are not allowed to use in the Residential College. Please remember that you are residing in a shared space and must demonstrate responsibility towards others. Furthermore, we specifically caution that any disciplinary action taken against you for violating regulations may also impact your eligibility for awards and honors as well as certain access within the Residential College. According to statistics from relevant departments of the university, more than ten students received disciplinary action in the last year for using prohibited electrical appliances.\n\n4.Parking Order\n\nIn order to maintain the order of the non-motorized vehicle parking areas surrounding the Residential College, a special rectification campaign on illegal parking in these areas will be conducted. with a three-tier reminder system consisting of yellow warnings, red penalties, and vehicle locking to penalize violations of parking regulations (details are shown in the diagram below). We urge all students to voluntarily abide by the parking regulations and jointly maintain a good parking environment. Additionally, as a friendly reminder to those who need it, the underground parking lot of Laitong College remains open and welcomes all students to use it after registering at the Laitong College front desk.\n\n\n\n5.Visitor Management\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of the Residential College, we kindly request all resident students to register any visits from opposite-sex guests at the front desk beforehand and to inform residents in the same unit. This will help us better understand the personnel movement and ensure the safety of other students.\n\nThank you all for your understanding and support! Let us work together to create a safe, harmonious, and civilized Residential College. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us at any time.\n\nBest Wishes": "Spam",
